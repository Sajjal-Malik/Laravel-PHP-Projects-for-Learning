✅ Task 0: Post Form with TextArea
🎯 Objective:
Build two separate Laravel forms to practice form handling, backend validation, string manipulation, and storing data using Eloquent models. The goal is to gain foundational experience with requests, controllers, models, views, and migrations in Laravel.

🔍 Laravel Learning Path Covered:
    1.1) Setting up Laravel project and structure

    1.2) Creating migrations and models

    1.4) Handling form requests and validation

    1.5) Laravel routes and controllers


📌 Scope of the Task:
This task is split into two subtasks:

    Remove Spaces from a Sentence

    Count Occurrences of a Word in a Paragraph

Each subtask includes:

    A form using Blade

    Server-side validation using Request::validate()

    Basic text manipulation using PHP functions

    Database interaction using Eloquent

    Returning output to the user in the same or a new view

🖥️ UI Description:
🔹 Subtask 1: Remove Spaces (First Form)

    A <textarea> for entering a sentence

    A submit button

After submission:

    All spaces are removed from the sentence

    The result is stored in the texts table

    The updated sentence is shown on the same page

View: first-form.blade.php
    Form Action: /remove/spaces (POST)


🔹 Subtask 2: Word Count (Second Form)
A form with:

    A text input for the word

    A <textarea> for the paragraph

On submit:

    The number of times the word appears in the paragraph is calculated (case-insensitive)

    Original data is saved to the paragraphs table

    Result is shown on a separate view (word-count.blade.php)

View: second-form.blade.php
    Form Action: /words/counts (POST)


🔨 Functionality Details:
Feature	Description
Sentence Form	Removes all spaces and stores result in texts table
Word Count Form	Counts how often a word appears in a paragraph, stores original inputs
Backend Validation	Laravel's $request->validate() ensures required fields are submitted
View Feedback	Displayed directly on submission pages or passed to a new Blade view


🗃️ Database Design:
texts Table:
    id (PK)

    sentence (text)

    timestamps

paragraphs Table:
    id (PK)

    word (text)

    paragraph (text)

    timestamps


🧪 Routes Overview:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/firstForm	Display sentence form
POST	/remove/spaces	Handle sentence form and remove spaces
GET	/secondForm	Display word count form
POST	/words/counts	Handle word count and show result
