✅ Task 2: List, Add & Edit User Module
🎯 Objective:
Design a full-featured User Management Module in Laravel using AJAX, Yajra DataTables, and validation techniques. This task focuses on implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality through modals, with both frontend and backend validation.

The main learning outcome is to apply key Laravel concepts in a practical UI: 
    validation, AJAX, modals, migrations, seeders, and data tables.


🔍 Laravel Learning Path Covered:
    1.1) Setting up Laravel project and structure

    1.2) Creating migrations and models

    1.3) Working with factories and seeders

    1.4) Handling form requests and validation

    1.5) Laravel routes and controllers

    2.1) Working with Yajra DataTables and AJAX


📌 Scope of the Task:
Validate form input using Parsley.js (Frontend) and Laravel Form Requests (Backend)

    Use AJAX for all create, update, and delete operations (no page reload)

    List users using Yajra DataTables

    Show user information using Bootstrap modals

    Provide feedback via alerts or modal-based messages

    Avoid repeating previous mistakes and improve code clarity and structure


🖥️ UI Description:
User Listing Page (Using Yajra DataTable via AJAX):

    Columns: firstName, lastName, email, password, age, phoneNumber, bio, DOB, Action

    A “Create” button is shown at the top-right above the table

    All actions (Create, View, Edit, Delete) are handled through modals using jQuery and AJAX


Actions:

    🔄 Update — Opens modal with pre-filled user info. Updates data via AJAX and refreshes the table.

    👁️ View — Opens modal in read-only mode to display user info.

    🗑️ Delete — Prompts for confirmation before deleting. On confirmation, deletes user and refreshes the DataTable via AJAX.


🔨 Functionality Details:
🔹 Add User:
    Opens a modal via “Create” button

    Frontend validation using Parsley.js

    Backend validation using Form Request

    On success, user is added and DataTable is refreshed without page reload



🔹 Edit User:
    Clicking “Edit” opens modal with user info fetched via AJAX

    Email field is non-editable

    On successful update, modal closes and table refreshes (AJAX)



🔹 View User:
    Opens a read-only modal with full user details



🔹 Delete User:
    Confirm dialog appears before delete

    If confirmed, delete is performed via AJAX

    DataTable updates without full page refresh



🗃️ Database Design:
User Table Columns:

    firstName

    lastName

    email (Non-editable)

    password

    age

    phoneNumber

    bio

    DOB


Tasks:

    Create a migration for the users table

    Create a seeder to insert sample user data



🧪 Routes Overview:
Method	Endpoint	Description
    POST	/users	Store new user
    GET	/users	List all users
    GET	/users/{userId}/edit	Fetch user for edit
    PUT	/users/{userId}	Update user info
    DELETE	/users/{userId}	Delete a user



🧰 Technologies & Tools Used:
    Laravel 10

    jQuery & AJAX

    Yajra DataTables

    Parsley.js for frontend validation

    Laravel Form Requests for backend validation

    Bootstrap Modals

    Font Awesome for action icons

    Eloquent ORM


✅ Learning Outcomes:
By completing this task, the intern will gain experience in:

    Creating responsive and dynamic CRUD interfaces

    Using DataTables for listing and AJAX for data operations

    Writing reusable modals for different operations

    Implementing both client-side and server-side validation

    Working with Laravel Migrations, Seeders, and Eloquent relationships (if extended)
